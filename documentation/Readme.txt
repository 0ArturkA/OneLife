==CONTROLS==

All in-game actions are accomplished with two mouse buttons, which do different
things depending on what you click on.

Left Click (main click):
--Walk somewhere
--Pick something up
--Do action
--Use held item
--Lots of other things, depending on context

Right Click (special click):
--Put what you're holding down, or into a container
--Remove an item from a container
--Use a weapon to kill someone

So, left for almost everything.  Right for drop/containers/killing.  



==CHAT==

The only thing that is NOT accomplished with the mouse is chat, which is
invoked by pressing ENTER, typing what you want to say, and pressing ENTER
again to say it.



==SETTINGS==

The game runs in fullscreen mode by default.  This behavior, and many other
behaviors, can be changed by editing the .ini files in the settings folder.
Simply open them in Notepad or any other text editor.  You can adjust the 
volume of sounds and music, window size, target frame rate, and so on.

Alt-Enter should work to toggle out of fullscreen mode and back into fullscreen
again, but sometimes, on some platforms, this does not work properly.
