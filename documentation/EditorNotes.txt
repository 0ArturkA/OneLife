This file explains various nuances of the editing process.




===TRANSITION EDITOR====

Transition block represents

    ACTOR  +  TARGET
           =
NEW ACTOR  +  NEW TARGET



==Moving Objects==

To specify what is left behind by a moving object, set ACTOR and NEW TARGET
to moving object (or before/after objects of move transition) and set
NEW ACTOR to what is left behind by moving object.

If moving object can consume an object that it moves onto, set TARGET as well.

Thus, a moving object can have distinct effects based on whether it is moving
into an empty space (bare ground) or moving onto an object that it can consume.
