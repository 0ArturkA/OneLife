1.  Use fast computer to ensure 60 fps during audio recording

2.  Move around world and talk live into mic.  Trim resulting audio 
    and save as mono AIFF.

3.  Switch on white background in makeAndView and then run it to test sync.

4.  Switch back to transparent background in makeAndView and run it one more 
    time.

5.  Run genMouthShapes on resulting audio like this (see makeAndView):

./genMouthShapes  test2.aiff  60 6 0.05 mouthShapes out mouthFrameList.txt 

6.  Copy mouthShapes folder and mouthFrameList into gameSource folder.

7.  Enable drawMouths and frame output in animation bank and rebuild game.

8.  Copy recoded game file into playback folder.

9.  Run and disable onscreen display during playback.  Frames output.

10. Save mono AIFF as a stereo WAV file.

11. Merge resulting frames with audio into a movie (see makeX264VideoTest)
    to test.

12. Convert frames to png for lightworks:
    mogrify -f png frame0*.tga

13. Load frames and audio into Lightworks and test.


Next:  In-game audio recording

14. Disable drawMouths in animation bank.

15. Edit minorGems/game/platforms/openGL/gameGraphicsGL.cpp to disable
    all drawSprite calls (for 60 fps during audio output).

16. Rebuild game.

16. Enable recordAudio setting and set recordAudioLengthInSeconds setting.

17. Run game again for another playback to output audio.

18. Converted recordedAudio.aiff in Audacity to make it compatible with 
    LightWorks (not sure what the problem is here).

19. Load resulting audio in Lightworks and sync it.
