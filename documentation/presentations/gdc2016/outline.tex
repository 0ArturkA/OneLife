\begin{itemize}

\item Let's think deeply about the content of the human world.

\item Arrowhead to iPhone span between hands.

\item 4000 years of incremental development across hundreds of loosely coordinated human generations.

\item We tend to think that we didn't have iPhones 4000 years ago because we didn't know HOW to make them.

\item What if it just took 4000 more years to build the necessary infrastructure?

\item If we had to start over again from scratch, naked in the wilderness, would we get there any faster, even if all modern knowledge was retained?

\item We certainly wouldn't have a semiconductor fabrication facility in one generation.  We might not even have screw drivers in one generation.

\item And you're not building a semiconductor factory without a screwdriver.

\item Make a game about this process:  a group of people starting from scratch, naked in the wilderness, and trying to coordinate a large-scale civilization building project across multiple generations.

\item This is a game about us each playing a small part in the middle of a very long story.

\item We've got hazy tales of what happened before we were born, and no access at all to what happens after we die.

\item We each have a very short time to make our little contribution to the world, and then we're gone.  We leave the rest up to those who come after us.

\item Hopefully, what we do in our lifetime will somehow be useful to them.

\item Imagine a multiplayer server filled with untouched wilderness that stretches infinitely in all directions.

\item The first player who joins the server is Eve, the first human in this world, and she starts at the coordinates 0,0.

\item Eve, and everyone else, will live approximately one hour of real time, with each minute marking a passing year in the game.

\item The second player to join the server is born to Eve as her first child, and they start out as a totally helpless baby.

\item With Eve's assistance, they may live to adulthood and be able to live on their own, but without help, they won't even survive a minute and they'll die in infancy.

\item Later players are born to Eve's grown children.  These children and grandchildren form the family tree that perpetuate civilization.  Each one participating for about an hour before dying.

\item Dead players can rejoin the world, but only as helpless babies born to other parents in different circumstances elsewhere in the world.  None of us can pick the situation that we're born into.

\item One question:  Will the stuff that you build in the world, during your lifetime, be understood and used by the generations that come after you?
