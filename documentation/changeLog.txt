Version 26     2017-July-1

--Fixed server crash when baby jumps out of arms.

--Fixed bug in logging age at time of death.

--Better logging of failed client connections.

--Piano note sound to indicate start of starvation, repeats on last hunger bar.

--Highlighting object under mouse.

--Fixed crash when pathfinding or clicking off edge of known map (in case of 
  server lag).

--Fixed a few uninitialized values found with Valgrind.

--New Eve placement method (random within radius around largest old camp).

--Clicking on empty ground cell containing a blocking object no longer counts
  as a click on that object.  Reduces surprise tree clicks.

--Dropped items that you're standing in front of are no longer clickable 
  through your body.

--Right clicking a holdable object while holding another object causes them
  to swap.  Can easily swap what you're holding with something else.

--Other player's eating sounds now play.

--After dying, upon getting reborn, whole connection process started from 
  scratch.  This insures that you will find out about a backup server if
  the main server has crashed (which may have caused your death).

--Time no longer halts during pause (server messages used to pile up during
  pause and play back all at once with wild results).

--Improved the way clothing R-values are summed, adding a weight for each body 
  part.  A hat is now more important than a shoe, and a really insulating shoe
  cannot make you overheat.

--Changed heat propagation to use eight weighted neighbor cells.

--Reduced number of heat propagation simulation cycles to slow heat changes.

--Mac build now defaults to windowed mode.

--Added code to tell Windows that we are handling our own scaling.

--Fixed game recording on Windows.

--Switched to GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP instead of gluBuild2DMipmaps on platforms
  that support it (gluBuild2DMipmaps was crashing on one particular mac).
