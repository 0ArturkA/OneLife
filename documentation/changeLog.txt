Version 27     ???

--Other player action animations no longer interrupt their walking if the 
  action message arrives before we see them finish their walk locally.

--Improved sprite trimming algorithm (used to tile large sprites to reduce
  pixel fill) to eliminate visible seams along tile boundaries by cross-fading
  tiles.

--Changed the way that actions of other players are handled, greatly increasing
  the smoothness of other player's motions and actions.  We now play other
  player's walking paths at our own rate and defer actions that should
  happen at the end of their walk (like picking something up) until after
  our local version of their walk has completed.  This means that the 
  truth as it exists on the server can play back with a time delay locally,
  but it will mesh up better with the walking actions we've received
  from the server (why show them pick something up if we haven't even
  shown them get there yet?  It looks weird, even if it's closer to the truth.
  This means that slightly more often, we'll go to grab an object that
  another player has already grabbed, and our client will know that it has
  been grabbed but won't show it yet because the other player isn't finished
  walking yet.  We'll be surprised when we fail to pick up the object and
  the other player gets it instead.  But this was possible before too,
  due to network latency.  Now we have an additional opportunity for it
  caused by local animation consistency latency.

--Fixed "forever flying" object pick-ups when we walk away after pick-up by
  gradually speeding the object up the longer it has been in the air, so
  it quickly catches up to us as we walk away.

--Fixed potential crash when the player holding you dies.

--Fixed circling forever at end of short paths by going directly toward final
  spot if we detect that too many steps have occurred.

--Pathmarking code now accounts for diagonal path steps.

--Support for making objects that are permanent and drawn behind player without
  blocking walking (e.g., roads).

--Fixed visual round-off errors at high coordinate values by offsetting all
  coordinates from our starting location before using them as to-draw positions
  (32 bit floats cannot represent large coordinates with enough precision).

--Map pull mode now auto-logs-in.




Server fixes:

--Fixed hiccup in parent animation when we're being carried long distances due
  to unneeded player updates mid-move when we reach a new map chunk.

--Fixed disappearing baby when you click on your clothes when holding a baby.
  (You now cannot remove your clothes while holding a baby.)  Thanks Josh C.

--Reflector now seeds random number generator with your IP address.  Repeat
  suicide and reconnection won't send you to different servers.

--Added sane behavior at actual edges of world instead of letting player walk
  off edge and cause a crash.





Version 26     2017-July-1

--Fixed server crash when baby jumps out of arms.

--Fixed bug in logging age at time of death.L

--Better logging of failed client connections.

--Piano note sound to indicate start of starvation, repeats on last hunger bar.

--Highlighting object under mouse.

--Fixed crash when pathfinding or clicking off edge of known map (in case of 
  server lag).

--Fixed a few uninitialized values found with Valgrind.

--New Eve placement method (random within radius around largest old camp).

--Clicking on empty ground cell containing a blocking object no longer counts
  as a click on that object.  Reduces surprise tree clicks.

--Dropped items that you're standing in front of are no longer clickable 
  through your body.

--Right clicking a holdable object while holding another object causes them
  to swap.  Can easily swap what you're holding with something else.

--Other player's eating sounds now play.

--After dying, upon getting reborn, whole connection process started from 
  scratch.  This insures that you will find out about a backup server if
  the main server has crashed (which may have caused your death).

--Time no longer halts during pause (server messages used to pile up during
  pause and play back all at once with wild results).

--Improved the way clothing R-values are summed, adding a weight for each body 
  part.  A hat is now more important than a shoe, and a really insulating shoe
  cannot make you overheat.

--Changed heat propagation to use eight weighted neighbor cells.

--Reduced number of heat propagation simulation cycles to slow heat changes.

--Mac build now defaults to windowed mode.

--Added code to tell Windows that we are handling our own scaling.

--Fixed game recording on Windows.

--Switched to GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP instead of gluBuild2DMipmaps on platforms
  that support it (gluBuild2DMipmaps was crashing on one particular mac).
